Welcome to my profile. This website reflects my personal views.

## About me 👩🏽‍💻

I'm a Data Scientist at the Bank of England specialising in NLP-based machine learning projects, quantitative finance methods and fintech solutions. During my time at the Bank, I've held a variety of roles covering data science, economics and risk-related topics. 

My role has also taken me abroad to Frankfurt, where I completed a secondment at Deutsche Bundesbank. It was a privilege working with the Banking and Finance Directorate General to shape a strategy for advancing AI capabilities and automating insights for the European Central Bank.

My data journey began even earlier. As a Summer Analyst at Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank, I developed quantitative strategies across Trade, Liquidity, FX and Debt Financing products, which led to achieving a Global Recognition Award. Before that, I completed an industrial placement at the Bank of England, where I introduced policy experts to the world of R and explored econometric concepts related to prudential policy. 

I completed a Masters in Artificial intelligence and Data Science from Northeastern University with Distinction. My thesis focused on comparing deep learning and statistical models for forecasting macroeconomic indicators. Prior to that, I studied Economics and Management at Aston University, where I received the Aston Excellence Scholarship and Economics Prize for highest academic performance. 

I served as President of Aston Women in Business Society (2019 - 2020), a platform dedicated to empowering women in the early stages of their careers through personal growth and professional development. As a mentor for Code First Girls, I've supported students from non-technical backgrounds build fluency in coding and equipped them with the skills, resources and connections they needed to thrive in data-driven roles.

## Additional Information 💬
🚀 Previously, I worked with founding members on early-stage start-up development at Chemist Direct. The company received investment from former Skype co-founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, now of VC fund Atomico.

👩‍⚖️ As a member of the UK Artificial Intelligence Public-Private Forum, I collaborated with international authorities and industry experts to explore the adoption, assessment and regulation of AI. 

🤖 My focus is on deploying ML/AI systems in production. I'm also exploring creative use cases of alternative data for market intelligence and predictive finance. 

I enjoy learning about fun technical challenges and collaborating with great teams. Reach out if you want to find a way to work together!
