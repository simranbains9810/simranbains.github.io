Welcome to my profile. This website reflects my personal views.

## About me üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª

I'm a Data Scientist at the [Bank of England](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/) specialising in NLP-based machine learning projects, quantitative finance methods and fintech solutions. During my time at the Bank, I've held a variety of roles covering data science, [regtech](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2023/july/transforming-data-collection-boe-and-fca-deliver-on-phase-one#:~:text=Policy%20makers%20are%20considering%20the,regulator%20response%20in%20Q4%202023.), economics and risk-related topics. 

My role has also taken me abroad to Frankfurt, where I completed a secondment at [Deutsche Bundesbank](https://www.bundesbank.de/en). It was a privilege working with the Banking and Finance Directorate General to shape a strategy for advancing AI capabilities and automating insights for the [European Central Bank](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/home/html/index.en.html).

My data journey began even earlier. As a Summer Analyst at [Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank](https://www.barclayscorporate.com/), I developed quantitative strategies across Trade, Liquidity, FX and Debt Financing products, which led to achieving a Global Recognition Award. Before that, I completed an industrial placement at the Bank of England, where I introduced policy experts to the world of R and explored econometric concepts related to prudential policy. 

I completed a Masters in Artificial intelligence and Data Science from Northeastern University with Distinction. My thesis focused on comparing deep learning and statistical models for forecasting macroeconomic indicators. I also qualified as a Chartered Data Scientist under the [British Computing Society](https://www.bcs.org/). Prior to that, I studied Economics and Management at Aston University, where I received the [Aston Excellence Scholarship](https://www.european-funding-guide.eu/scholarship/1178-aston-excellence-scholarship) and Economics Prize for highest academic performance. 

I served as President of [Aston Women in Business Society](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aston-womeninbusiness/posts/?feedView=all) (2019 - 2020), a platform dedicated to empowering women in the early stages of their careers through personal growth and professional development. As a mentor for [Code First Girls](https://codefirstgirls.com/), I've supported students from non-technical backgrounds build fluency in coding and equipped them with the skills, resources and connections they needed to thrive in data-driven roles.

## Additional Information üí¨
üöÄ Previously, I worked with founding members on early-stage start-up development at [Chemist Direct](https://www.barclayscorporate.com/). The company received [investment](https://www.business-live.co.uk/professional-services/banking-finance/smethwick-online-chemist-wins-3m-3949072) from former Skype co-founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, now of VC fund Atomico.

üìö I've delivered guest lectures at the London School of Economics, Warwick Business School and Northeastern University.

üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è As a member of the [UK Artificial Intelligence Public-Private Forum](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/fintech/ai-public-private-forum), I collaborated with international authorities and industry experts to explore the adoption, assessment and regulation of AI. 

ü§ñ My focus is on deploying ML/AI systems in production. I'm also exploring creative use cases of alternative data for market intelligence and predictive finance. 

I enjoy learning about fun technical challenges and collaborating with great teams. Reach out if you want to find a way to work together!
