Welcome to my personal profile. This website expresses my personal views.

## About me 👩🏽‍💻

I'm a Data Scientist at the Bank of England, working on NLP-based machine learning projects, quantitative finance methods and fintech solutions. 

My role has also taken me abroad to Frankfurt, where I completed a secondment at Deutsche Bundesbank. It was a privilege working with the Banking and Finance Directorate General to shape a strategy for advancing AI capabilities and automating insights for the European Central Bank.

My data journey began even earlier. As a Summer Analyst at Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank, I developed quantitative strategies across Trade, Liquidity, FX and Corporate Finance products, which led to achieving a Global Recognition Award. Prior to that, I completed an industrial placement at the Bank of England, helping introduce policy experts to the world of R and exploring econometric concepts related to prudential policy. 

I completed a Masters in Artificial intelligence and Data Science from Northeastern University with Distinction. Prior to that, I studied Economics and Management at Aston University, where I received the Aston Excellence Scholarship and Economics Prize for highest academic performance. I also served as President of Aston Women in Business Society (2019 - 2020), a platform focused on empowering women in the early stages of their careers through personal growth and professional development. 

I'm passionate about creating progressive learning environments that enhance data science capabilities. As a mentor for Code First Girls, I've supported students from non-technical backgrounds build fluency in coding and equipped them with the skills, resources and connections they need to thrive in data-driven roles.

## Additional Information 💬
🚀 Previously, I worked with founding members on early-stage start-up development and e-commerce tooling at Chemist Direct. The company received investment from former Skype co-founders Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, now of VC fund Atomico.

👩‍⚖️ As a member of the Artificial Intelligence Public-Private Forum, I collaborated with international authorities and industry experts to explore the adoption, assessment and regulation of AI. 

🤖 My focus is on deploying ML/AI systems in production. I'm also exploring creative use cases of alternative data for macroeconomic insights and predictive finance. 

I'm best reached via email. I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
